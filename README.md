# Final-Project

# Water Molecules
Simulation of forming water from Hydrogen and Oxygen molecules.

This project is simulation of how water was created by using scientific explanation and visualization.
It offers experience of player mixing Hydrogen and Oxygen together to create water.

The UML class diagram can be looked in the repository. Please excuse me for I do not know how to add image file in this README.

How to install this program?
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open file in any IDE.
3. Look for water.py and run it.

You can change color of Oxygen stoms, Hydrogen atoms and water molecules.

Each class cooperate to run the program in the last class, Simulation.
I use Professot Paruj's ball_bouncing_sim repository as the base code, them I adjusted and simplified some of the code.
The code can work properly as I tested it a couple times.

I rate my project 81 because of simplicity.
